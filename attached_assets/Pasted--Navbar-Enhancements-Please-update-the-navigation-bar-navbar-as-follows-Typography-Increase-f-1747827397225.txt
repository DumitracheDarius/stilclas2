üß≠ Navbar Enhancements
Please update the navigation bar (navbar) as follows:

Typography:
Increase font weight on all navbar items (e.g., use font-weight: 600 or higher).
Make sure they are easily readable and appear bold enough to stand out.
Dynamic Color Logic Based on Background:
If the background of the section behind the navbar is black or dark, automatically set all navbar items, icons, and buttons to white for contrast.
If the background is white or light, automatically switch all navbar elements to black.
This ensures optimal readability and visual contrast at all times.
This dynamic behavior should work across all scroll sections and on all devices (desktop and mobile).
