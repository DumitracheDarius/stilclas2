### ‚ú® Project Goal

Create a **fully responsive**, **modern**, and **luxurious website** for **StilClas**, a fashion brand specializing in **premium suits and elegant menswear**.
The website must reflect the core values of the brand: **refinement, confidence, minimalism, and visual clarity**.

The brand should feel like a **high-end fashion house**, combining **sophisticated design** with **cutting-edge technology**.

---

### üñºÔ∏è Logo

The logo has been uploaded and must be placed:

* In the **header** (top-left)
* As a **favicon**
* Optionally in the **footer**

Extract the **main burgundy color** from the logo (approx. `#7E1F2D`) and use it as the **primary accent color** across the entire website.

---

### üé® Color Palette (Strictly Use Only These)

* **Black**: `#000000` ‚Äì primary background and text color
* **White**: `#FFFFFF` ‚Äì clean contrast, sections, and backgrounds
* **Burgundy**: `#7E1F2D` ‚Äì from logo, used for:

  * Button highlights (hover and default)
  * Section headers
  * Icons, underlines, borders
  * Active nav links and accents

The overall visual identity should be **polished, readable, and harmonious**, avoiding visual noise. Every section should **breathe** through intelligent use of whitespace.

---

### üñã Typography

* **Headings**: Use `"Playfair Display"` ‚Äì for elegance and class
* **Body text**: Use `"Lato"` or `"Inter"` ‚Äì for modern readability
* Font weights should balance elegance with clarity (e.g., 300‚Äì600)

---

### üß± Layout & Design System

* Layout must be **fully aligned**:

  * If there are multiple cards in a row (e.g., 3 product cards or info sections), make sure **all text, images, and buttons are perfectly aligned** across all cards
  * Ensure **grid consistency** (12-column layout or equivalent for responsiveness)
  * Maintain **equal padding/margin** between components
* All call-to-action buttons must be:

  * Equal size
  * Center-aligned within their parent
  * Styled with **rounded corners**, **subtle shadows**, and **color transitions**
* Use **smooth animations** (e.g., `ease-in-out 0.3s`) for all interactive elements
