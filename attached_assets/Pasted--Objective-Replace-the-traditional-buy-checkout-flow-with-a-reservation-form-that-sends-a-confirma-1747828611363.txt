🔄 Objective
Replace the traditional buy/checkout flow with a reservation form that sends a confirmation email to the store using EmailJS.

Users will no longer buy online — instead, they will reserve items and come to the store to purchase them in person.

🧩 Complete Flow Using EmailJS
1. 🛒 Add to Cart (same as before)

Users browse the shop.
They click “Add to Cart” as normal.
Products are shown in the cart view.
2. 🛍️ Cart Page – Replace Purchase Action

On the cart page:

Remove any "Checkout", "Buy", or payment buttons.
Add one single button:
Romanian: Rezervă în magazin
English: Reserve in Store
3. 📋 Open Reservation Form Modal

When the user clicks the button, open a modal or form asking for:

Full Name (Nume complet)
Email Address (Adresă de email)
Preferred Pickup Date (Data dorită pentru achiziție)
✔️ The form should:

Work on both desktop and mobile
Include required field validation
Be styled consistently with the rest of the website
Support language toggle between RO/EN
4. 📤 On Submit → Send Email via EmailJS

Once the form is submitted:

Use EmailJS to send an automatic email to the store with the following details:
✉️ EmailJS Integration
Use the following EmailJS parameters:
