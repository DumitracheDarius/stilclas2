Great job so far ‚Äî the translation toggle works well and the hero section looks great. Now please continue with the following:

---

### üåê Complete Homepage Translation

Translate **all remaining sections on the homepage** into **both Romanian and English**, and integrate them with the existing language switcher.

The sections that must be fully localized:

* **New Collections**
* **Best Sellers**
* **Our Values**
* **Client Testimonials**

All titles, descriptions, buttons, and captions must switch correctly when the language is toggled.

### üñºÔ∏è Replace Stock Images with Uploaded Images (Everywhere)

Just like you already did with the hero section, now please **replace all other stock images on the homepage** with **new ones from my uploaded image folder**.

Important:

* Use **different images** for each section (don‚Äôt reuse the same image across multiple blocks).
* Choose relevant images based on the section:

  * For **New Collections**: show sharp images of new suits or shirts.
  * For **Best Sellers**: use product images of popular items.
  * For **Our Values**: visual representation of craftsmanship, tailoring, or customer service.
  * For **Testimonials**: either background visuals or profile-like images (if applicable).

### üìÑ Apply Same Changes to the Following Pages

Repeat the **image replacement and full translation logic** for the following internal pages:

1. **About Us**

   * Replace any existing stock/team/atelier images with new ones.
   * Make sure all text is fully available in both Romanian and English.

2. **Collections**

   * All collection category visuals must be updated.
   * The categories and subcategories defined earlier must be translated and navigable in both languages.

3. **Shop**

   * Ensure product previews are updated with new visuals.
   * All product details, buttons, filters, and UI elements must support dual language switching.

4. **Contact**

   * Translate all fields, placeholder texts, and descriptions.
   * Replace any stock contact/location visuals with brand-aligned images.

### ‚úÖ Final Notes

* Do **not reuse the same image repeatedly** across multiple sections.
* Maintain alignment, consistent sizing, and elegant styling.
* Ensure language switching is **instant and seamless** on every page.
