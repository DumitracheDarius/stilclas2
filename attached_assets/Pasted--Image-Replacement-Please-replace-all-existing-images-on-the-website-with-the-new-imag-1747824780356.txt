### 🖼️ Image Replacement

Please replace **all existing images** on the website with the **new images from the folder: /imagini_StilClas_website **. These will represent the updated, high-quality visuals of the StilClas brand.
**Do not use any other stock photos** – only use the ones I provide.

Make sure all image placements remain **elegant, centered, and responsive**, and all cards, banners, and galleries are **updated accordingly**.

### 🌍 Multilingual Support (Romanian + English)

The primary language of the website must be **Romanian**.

Add a **language switch button** (preferably in the header or top-right corner) that allows the user to toggle between **Romanian** and **English**.

* Use clear and complete Romanian text across all pages (buttons, navigation, headings).
* When the switch is toggled to English, replace all relevant content accordingly.
* Make sure the switcher is animated or clearly styled to reflect the current language.
