Hello! I need several visual and functional improvements for my project. Please follow the detailed instructions below and make sure everything fits well with the overall design and structure of the website:

1. 3D Effect Behind Logo
I would like the logo in the header to have a modern and elegant 3D shadow/glow effect behind it. The purpose is to make the logo stand out and remain clearly visible regardless of the background color of the header. The effect should:

Be subtle but noticeable.
Enhance readability and branding.
Work both on light and dark backgrounds.
Fit the visual style of a sleek, professional website (no tacky or cartoonish effects).
Ideally, use CSS (or WebGL if already used in project) for performant rendering.
Example techniques that could work:

Soft ambient drop shadow (light + dark layers).
Neon glow-like border with low opacity.
Perspective transform or layered z-depth blur.
2. New Section on Home Page – “Where to find us?”
Please create a new section immediately after the Hero component on the Home Page with the following structure:

Title (Translated):

Unde ne găsiți? (Romanian)
Where to find us? (English)
Text:

Amplasat în incinta APACA, Cotroceni Business Center Str. Iuliu Maniu, Nr. 7, corpul U, etaj 1 București 061072, România
Ensure that this component follows the same i18n translation setup as other sections (e.g., if the site has a language switcher).

3. Google Maps Integration
Under the new "Where to find us?" section, please integrate a Google Maps iframe or custom map embed that does the following:

Places a Pin exactly on the address: Cotroceni Business Center, Str. Iuliu Maniu, Nr. 7, corpul U, etaj 1, București 061072
Above the Pin, add a small label that says: "Aici ne găsești!" (Here you can find us!)
Make sure the map is zoomed in enough so that the user clearly sees the building.
The same Pin with the same accuracy should also be updated/shown in the Contact page map, for consistency.
Use either:

Google Maps embed with custom marker,
Or a library like react-google-maps if applicable.
4. Shop Currency Change
Please update the Shop section so that the prices are displayed in LEI (RON - Romanian Leu) instead of USD. Make sure:

Currency symbol and formatting match Romanian standards (e.g., 99,99 LEI).
If you're using a library like react-intl, set the currency locale accordingly.
All cart/checkout components reflect this change.
Thank you!
